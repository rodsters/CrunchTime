// Made by Jasper Fadden
// This is an upgraded draft of Rainbow Man's player controller. The movement code utilizes the ADSR system often seen in music that our professor described in a lecture. This allows smooth slow-down and speed-up physics that make movement feel much less rigid. The controller also implements some rudimentary animation (having the player turn to face the mouse), player statistics like shooting speed and inaccuracy, and more.
